# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Network Traffic Analysis

### Typology of the TCPDump Log Data

The tcpdump and Wireshark output contain several structural elements that describe how the TCP handshake attempts and HTTP requests were transmitted. These elements help classify the traffic and understand the failure.



### Timestamp

* Each entry begins with a timestamp such as **3.144521**.
* Indicates the precise moment the packet was observed.
* Format: **seconds.milliseconds** from the start of capture.

### Source and Destination IP Addresses

* **Legitimate employee traffic:**

  * **Source:** 198.51.100.x (employee machines)
  * **Destination:** 192.0.2.1 (company web server)

* **Attacker traffic:**

  * **Source:** 203.0.113.0
  * **Destination:** 192.0.2.1

### Protocols Observed

* **TCP**

  * Used for establishing connections to port 443.
  * Displays SYN, SYN‑ACK, ACK, RST‑ACK, and HTTP messages.

* **HTTP**

  * Used only when a full TCP handshake succeeds.

### Ports and Services

* **TCP port 443**

  * Standard port for HTTPS web traffic.
  * Target of both legitimate users and the attacker.

### TCP Handshake Metadata

* **SYN**

  * Initial request to establish a connection.

!\[Flood Analysis](screenshots/Image%20(6).png)

* **SYN‑ACK**

  * Server’s response acknowledging the request.


!\[Flood Analysis](screenshots/Image%20(7).png)

* **ACK**

  * Final step completing the handshake.


!\[Flood Analysis](screenshots/Image%20(8).png)

* **RST‑ACK**

  * Reset packet sent when the server cannot maintain or complete a connection.

### Traffic Pattern Notes

* Legitimate users show normal **SYN → SYN‑ACK → ACK** sequences.

* Attacker repeatedly sends **SYN** packets without completing the handshake.

* Yellow‑coded entries show legitimate traffic failing due to server overload.

* HTTP 504 errors indicate upstream timeout caused by server unresponsiveness.

## Part 1: Summary of the Problem Found in the TCP Traffic Log

The network analysis shows that the web server at **192.0.2.1** was overwhelmed by a large number of TCP SYN packets originating from **203.0.113.0**. These packets simulate the first step of a TCP handshake but never complete it.


As the attack escalated:

* The server initially responded with SYN‑ACK packets.
* The attacker continued sending SYN packets at a high rate.
* Legitimate employee traffic began failing.
* The server eventually stopped responding entirely.


### Possible Issues Identified

* Server overwhelmed by half‑open TCP connections
* SYN queue exhaustion
* Resource starvation (CPU, memory, connection table)
* Upstream gateway timeouts due to server unresponsiveness
* RST‑ACK packets sent to legitimate users as the server fails to maintain state
* Complete service outage caused by sustained SYN flood

## Part 2: Analysis of the Data and Likely Cause of the Incident

### Time of Incident

* Attack activity begins around **3.39 seconds** into the capture.
* Server failure becomes evident around **6–7 seconds**.
* By **21 seconds**, the server stops responding to legitimate traffic entirely.


### How the IT Team Became Aware

* Employees reported that the company website was timing out.
* HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors appeared in browsers.
* Some users received immediate connection resets.


### Actions Taken by the IT Department

* Loaded Wireshark and tcpdump to analyze live traffic.
* Observed:

  * Normal employee SYN/SYN‑ACK/ACK sequences.
  * Repeated SYN packets from attacker IP 203.0.113.0.
  * Increasing number of RST‑ACK packets sent to legitimate users.
  * HTTP 504 errors generated by the gateway server.

### Key Findings from the Investigation

* The attacker repeatedly sent SYN packets without completing the handshake.
* The server attempted to respond but became overloaded.
* Legitimate users began receiving:

  * **RST‑ACK** packets
  * **HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout** errors

* After log entry **125**, the server stopped responding to all legitimate traffic.
* Only attack traffic continued to appear in the logs.

### Likely Causes of the Incident

* Direct DoS SYN flood attack from a single IP address
* Exhaustion of the server’s TCP connection table
* Server unable to allocate resources for legitimate connections
* Gateway timeouts caused by server unresponsiveness
* Service outage due to sustained SYN packet flooding
